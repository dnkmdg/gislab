GIS Laboration
======

This example is a simple laboration to show what possibilities modern GIS-frameworks gives us to illustrate and display data as opposed to the classic interfaces. 

It's built with Leaflet, OSM, OSM Buildings and some lightly edited raw data from my local municipality (Stadsbyggnadskontoret, Kristianstad kommun).
